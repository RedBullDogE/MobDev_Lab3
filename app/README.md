App consists of MainActivity with ViewPagerAdapter which displays two fragments (movie list - MovieListFragment and blank - AnotherOneFragment).

1. Tabs was implemented with TabLayout and ViewPagerAdapter
2. Movie class was created for describing movie entity.
3. All movies are stored in movieList: ArrayList<Movie> in CustomMovieListAdapter
4. The list of movies as view are implemented in CustomMovieListAdapter. This adapter is responsible for displaying movie_item views

The main problem was to set up adapters to work with tabs (viewpager) and fragments and understand the logic of their work
